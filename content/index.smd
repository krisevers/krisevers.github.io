Hi there! I'm Kris. I love tinkering with hard problems.

I've worked in computational neuroscience at Maastricht University on biophysical models of the human brain, and developed data analysis pipelines of MRI.
A lot of things interest me so this is a place where I organize my ideas.
I write about a wide range of topics and projects.
