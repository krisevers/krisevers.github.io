#### Introduction section:

Add specific examples of the computational challenges each subfield faces (e.g., phylogenetic tree reconstruction in evolution, protein folding simulations in molecular biology)
Explain why current isolated approaches fail for multi-scale problems - what specific technical barriers exist?

#### Digital twins section:

Expand on what makes multi-scale integration so difficult technically. Why can't we just connect existing models?
Give a concrete example of how blood sample data and fMRI would actually conflict or require different modeling approaches
Discuss current attempts at digital twins and where they're falling short

#### Data-Oriented Design section:

Compare DOD more directly to how biological modeling currently works. What would a typical neuroscience simulation look like in OOD vs DOD?
Add technical details about performance benefits - cache hits, memory bandwidth, vectorization opportunities
Include a concrete code example or pseudocode showing the difference

#### Compositionality section:

Develop the muscle cell example into a full walkthrough showing how the same data structures would be accessed by neural, cellular, and tissue-level systems
Discuss how this differs from current approaches where each scale has its own data formats and interfaces
Address potential downsides - what complexity does this separation introduce?

#### Performance section:

Quantify the performance claims with examples from game engines or other DOD applications
Discuss specific parallelization strategies that become possible
Address the trade-offs between performance and model interpretability
