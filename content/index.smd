## Hi There!
I love tinkering with hard problems and algorithms.
I've worked in **computational neuroscience** at Maastricht University on biophysical models of the human brain, developing methods for analyzing complex spatio-temporal neurobiological data.
A lot of things interest me and this is the place where I organize my ideas and share what I learn along the way.

I write about a wide range of topics and projects â€” from optimizing **biophysics** simulations and building **data-analysis** pipelines,
to exploring **machine learning** techniques and interesting algorithmic challenges. I'm especially drawn to problems **where mathematical insight meets practical implementation**.

If you're working on related problems and think we might have something to discuss, I'd love to hear from you!
